atmospheretest
======
This is just a small application to test out the capabilities of the [Atmosphere framework](http://atmosphere.java.net//) 
with different browers (any maybe also servers).


I've just installed the [Grails Atmosphere plugin] (http://www.grails.org/plugin/atmosphere)
and the Grails jQuery plugin.

You should have a look at the following resources:
- TestController.groovy
- BoardService.groovy
- the view test/show.gsp

Apart from that - this is just a raw & blank Grails project.

I've downloaded the jQuery Atmosphere plugin (jquery.atmosphere.js) in order to easily handle the client side
channel subscription etc.
The file is contained in the war file from the following [this location](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/org/atmosphere/atmosphere-jquery/0.7.1/) 
(didn't really found the plugin in the official jQuery plugin repository).


Apart from that there are also a lot of great examples on the [Atmosphere Project page](http://atmosphere.java.net/)
and some usefull background information on the Grails plugin in [this blogpost](http://codeyeti.com/posts/ajax-push-in-grails-using-the-atmosphere-plugin/).
